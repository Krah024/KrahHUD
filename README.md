KrahHUD (WIP)
Made by Krah
Originally made for 4:3 (stretched) But updated mainly for 16:9 (1920 x 1080) and should work on others.

BTW FYI, Most parts in this hud are not (in any way, shape or form) mine.
originaly, this hud was a private creation and was not for public use.
so if you are reading this and/or using the hud (please) It seems I changed my mind (duh).
If there are bugs and whatnot, I probably won't have the time to fix them.
or i'm just too lazy... yep.
